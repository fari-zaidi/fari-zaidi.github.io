# My Portfolio

## Some of my selected major projects in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Statistics, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### Melanoma Skin Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network Algorithms:
In this project, I focused on building CNN-based architecture models to detect melanoma skin cancer from a dataset of 25,331 images obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes two CSV files providing details about the skin lesions and patient metadata. My goal is to develop accurate predictive models for early detection of melanoma, contributing to improved patient outcomes. This project addresses the crucial need for reliable and efficient methods of diagnosing skin cancer, ultimately saving lives through early intervention.
